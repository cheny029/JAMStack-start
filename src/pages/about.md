## I Am Alan Chen
Iâ€™m a design strategist graduated from Parsons The New School of Design currently based in New York City. I was major in Strategy Design and Management and minor in Communication Design.

As a design strategist, I have a strong interest in human-centered strategy design and design thinking research methods. I love to observe the interaction between people, items, and the environment.
